Project Castaway is a Vulkan-based rendering engine built on Rust with a focus on native raytracing.

## :warning: __Project Castaway is currently heavily experimental and far from feature-complete.__ :warning:

If you'd like to help, feel free to reach out!

Curently, Project Castaway is very heavily based on [adrien-ben](https://github.com/adrien-ben)'s work on [vulkan-examples-rs](https://github.com/adrien-ben/vulkan-examples-rs). In fact, the entire underlying library was shamefully taken from that project, with the intent of starting with a functional foundation, and modifying it as needed to conform to our needs and constraints.

I haven't yet decided on any specific design goals, so if you'd like to help shape this project, feel free to jump on board! :)
