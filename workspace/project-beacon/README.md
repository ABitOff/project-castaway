# Project Beacon

Project Beacon is the rendering engine component of Project Castaway. It has a focus on speed, ease-of-use, and feature-completeness. 

Curently, Project Beacon is very heavily based on [adrien-ben](https://github.com/adrien-ben)'s work on [vulkan-examples-rs](https://github.com/adrien-ben/vulkan-examples-rs). In fact, the entire underlying library was shamefully taken from that project, with the intent of starting with a functional foundation, and modifying it as needed to conform to our needs and constraints.
